            (Optional) Tuple of C{ctypes} data types that constitute the
            hooked function signature. When the function is called, this will
            be used to parse the arguments from the stack. Overrides the
            C{paramCount} argument.

            Memory address of code instruction to break at. It can be an
            integer value for the actual address or a string with a label
            to be resolved.

            Note that all pointer types are treated like void pointers, so your
            callback won't get the string or structure pointed to by it, but
            the remote memory address instead. This is so to prevent the ctypes
            library from being "too helpful" and trying to dereference the
            pointer. To get the actual data being pointed to, use one of the
            L{Process.read} methods.

        @type  postCB: function
        @param postCB: (Optional) Callback triggered on function exit.

            The signature for the callback should be something like this::

                def post_LoadLibraryEx(event, return_value):

                    # (...)

        @type  paramCount: int
        @param paramCount:
            (Optional) Number of parameters for the C{preCB} callback,
            not counting the return address. Parameters are read from
            the stack and assumed to be DWORDs in 32 bits and QWORDs in 64.
