```
 by
hand, but instead use the `~.RequestHandler.render` and
`~.RequestHandler.render_string` methods of
`tornado.web.RequestHandler`, which load templates automatically based
on the ``template_path`` `.Application` setting.

Variable names beginning with ``_tt_`` are reserved by the template
system and should not be used by application code.

Syntax Reference
----------------

Template expressions are surrounded by double curly braces: ``{{ ... }}``.
The contents may be any python expression, which will be escaped according
to the current autoescape setting and inserted into the output.  Other
template directives use ``{% %}``.

To comment out a section so that it is omitted from the output, surround it
with ``{# ... #}``.


To include a literal ``{{``, ``{%``, or ``{#`` in the output, escape them as
``{{!``, ``{%!``, and ``{#!``, respectively.


``{% apply *function* %}...{% end %}``
    Applies a function to the output of all template code between ``apply``
    and ``end``::

        {% apply linkify %}{{name}} said: {{message}}{% end %}

    Note that as an implementation detail apply blocks are implemented
    as nested functions and thus may interact strangely with variables
    set via ``{% set %}``, or the use of ``{% break %}`` or ``{% continue %}``
    within loops.

``{% autoescape *function* %}``
    Sets the autoescape mode for the current file.  This does not affect
    other files, even those referenced by ``{% include %}``.  Note that
    autoescaping can also be configured globally, at the `.Application`
    or `Loader`.::

        {% autoescape xhtml_escape %}
        {% autoescape None %}

``{% block *name* %}...{% end %}``
    Indicates a named, replaceable block for use with ``{% extends %}``.
    Blocks in the parent template will be replaced with the contents of
    the same-named block in a child template.::

        <!-- base.html -->
        <title>{% block title %}Default title{% end %}</title>

        <!-- mypage.html -->
        {% extends "base.html" %}
        {% block title %}My page title{% end %}

``{% comment ... %}``
    A comment which will be removed from the template output.  Note that
    there is no ``{% end %}`` tag; the comment goes from the word ``comment``
    to the closing ``%}`` tag.

``{% extends *filename* %}``
    Inherit from another template.  Templates that use ``extends`` should
    contain one or more ``block`` tags to replace content from the parent
    template.  Anything in the child template not contained in a ``block``
    tag will be ignored.  For an example, see the ``{% block %}`` tag.

``{% for *var* in *expr* %}...{% end %}``
    Same as the python ``for`` statement.  ``{% break %}`` and
    ``{% continue %}`` may be used inside the loop.

``{% from *x* import *y* %}``
    Same as the python ``import`` statement.

``{% if *condition* %}...{% elif *condition* %}...{% else %}...{% end %}``
```
