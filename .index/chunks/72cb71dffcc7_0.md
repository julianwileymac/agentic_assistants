Verbose and colourful traceback formatting.

**ColorTB**

I've always found it a bit hard to visually parse tracebacks in Python.  The
ColorTB class is a solution to that problem.  It colors the different parts of a
traceback in a manner similar to what you would expect from a syntax-highlighting
text editor.

Installation instructions for ColorTB::

    import sys,ultratb
    sys.excepthook = ultratb.ColorTB()

**VerboseTB**

I've also included a port of Ka-Ping Yee's "cgitb.py" that produces all kinds
of useful info when a traceback occurs.  Ping originally had it spit out HTML
and intended it for CGI programmers, but why should they have all the fun?  I
altered it to spit out colored text to the terminal.  It's a bit overwhelming,
but kind of neat, and maybe useful for long-running programs that you believe
are bug-free.  If a crash *does* occur in that type of program you want details.
Give it a shot--you'll love it or you'll hate it.

.. note::

  The Verbose mode prints the variables currently visible where the exception
  happened (shortening their strings if too long). This can potentially be
  very slow, if you happen to have a huge data structure whose string
  representation is complex to compute. Your computer may appear to freeze for
  a while with cpu usage at 100%. If this occurs, you can cancel the traceback
  with Ctrl-C (maybe hitting it more than once).

  If you encounter this kind of situation often, you may want to use the
  Verbose_novars mode instead of the regular Verbose, which avoids formatting
  variables (but otherwise includes the information and context given by
  Verbose).

.. note::

  The verbose mode print all variables in the stack, which means it can
  potentially leak sensitive information like access keys, or unencrypted
  password.

Installation instructions for VerboseTB::

    import sys,ultratb
    sys.excepthook = ultratb.VerboseTB()

Note:  Much of the code in this module was lifted verbatim from the standard
library module 'traceback.py' and Ka-Ping Yee's 'cgitb.py'.
