# websocket-client

websocket-client is a WebSocket client for Python. It provides access
to low level APIs for WebSockets. websocket-client implements version
[hybi-13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-13)
of the WebSocket protocol. This client does not currently support the
permessage-deflate extension from
[RFC 7692](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692).

## Installation

You can use `pip install websocket-client` to install, or `pip install -e .`
to install from a local copy of the code. This module is tested on Python 3.9+.

There are several optional dependencies that can be installed to enable
specific websocket-client features.
- To install `python-socks` for proxy usage and `wsaccel` for a minor performance boost, use:
 `pip install websocket-client[optional]`
- To install `websockets` to run unit tests using the local echo server, use:
 `pip install websocket-client[test]`
- To install `Sphinx` and `sphinx_rtd_theme` to build project documentation, use:
 `pip install websocket-client[docs]`

While not a strict dependency, [rel](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/registeredeventlistener)
is useful when using `run_forever` with automatic reconnect. Install rel with `pip install rel`.

Footnote: Some shells, such as zsh, require you to escape the `[` and `]` characters with a `\`.

## Usage Tips

Check out the documentation's FAQ for additional guidelines:
[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)

Known issues with this library include lack of WebSocket Compression
support (RFC 7692) and [minimal threading documentation/support](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/threading.html).

## Performance

The `send` and `validate_utf8` methods can sometimes be bottleneck.
You can disable UTF8 validation in this library (and receive a
performance enhancement) with the `skip_utf8_validation` parameter.
If you want to get better performance, install wsaccel. While
websocket-client does not depend on wsaccel, it will be used if
available. wsaccel doubles the speed of UTF8 validation and
offers a very minor 10% performance boost when masking the
payload data as part of the `send` process. Numpy used to
