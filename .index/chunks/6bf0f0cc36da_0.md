"""A command line parsing module that lets modules define their own options.

This module is inspired by Google's `gflags
<https://github.com/google/python-gflags>`_. The primary difference
with libraries such as `argparse` is that a global registry is used so
that options may be defined in any module (it also enables
`tornado.log` by default). The rest of Tornado does not depend on this
module, so feel free to use `argparse` or other configuration
libraries if you prefer them.

Options must be defined with `tornado.options.define` before use,
generally at the top level of a module. The options are then
accessible as attributes of `tornado.options.options`::

    # myapp/db.py
    from tornado.options import define, options

    define("mysql_host", default="127.0.0.1:3306", help="Main user DB")
    define("memcache_hosts", default="127.0.0.1:11011", multiple=True,
           help="Main user memcache servers")

    def connect():
        db = database.Connection(options.mysql_host)
        ...

    # myapp/server.py
    from tornado.options import define, options

    define("port", default=8080, help="port to listen on")

    def start_server():
        app = make_app()
        app.listen(options.port)

The ``main()`` method of your application does not need to be aware of all of
the options used throughout your program; they are all automatically loaded
when the modules are loaded.  However, all modules that define options
must have been imported before the command line is parsed.

Your ``main()`` method can parse the command line or parse a config file with
either `parse_command_line` or `parse_config_file`::

    import myapp.db, myapp.server
    import tornado

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        tornado.options.parse_command_line()
        # or
        tornado.options.parse_config_file("/etc/server.conf")

.. note::

   When using multiple ``parse_*`` functions, pass ``final=False`` to all
   but the last one, or side effects may occur twice (in particular,
   this can result in log messages being doubled).

`tornado.options.options` is a singleton instance of `OptionParser`, and
the top-level functions in this module (`define`, `parse_command_line`, etc)
simply call methods on it.  You may create additional `OptionParser`
instances to define isolated sets of options, such as for subcommands.
