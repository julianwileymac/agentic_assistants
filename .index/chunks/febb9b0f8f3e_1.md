```
ll httpx
```

Now, let's get started:

```pycon
>>> import httpx
>>> r = httpx.get('https://www.example.org/')
>>> r
<Response [200 OK]>
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
>>> r.text
'<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Example Domain</title>...'
```

Or, using the command-line client.

```shell
$ pip install 'httpx[cli]'  # The command line client is an optional dependency.
```

Which now allows us to use HTTPX directly from the command-line...

## Features

HTTPX builds on the well-established usability of `requests`, and gives you:

* A broadly [requests-compatible API](https://www.python-httpx.org/compatibility/).
* An integrated command-line client.
* HTTP/1.1 [and HTTP/2 support](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/).
* Standard synchronous interface, but with [async support if you need it](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/).
* Ability to make requests directly to [WSGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/#wsgi-transport) or [ASGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/#asgi-transport).
* Strict timeouts everywhere.
* Fully type annotated.
* 100% test coverage.

Plus all the standard features of `requests`...

* International Domains and URLs
* Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
* Sessions with Cookie Persistence
* Browser-style SSL Verification
* Basic/Digest Authentication
* Elegant Key/Value Cookies
* Automatic Decompression
* Automatic Content Decoding
* Unicode Response Bodies
* Multipart File Uploads
* HTTP(S) Proxy Support
* Connection Timeouts
* Streaming Downloads
* .netrc Support
* Chunked Requests

## Installation

Install with pip:

```shell
$ pip install httpx
```

Or, to include the optional HTTP/2 support, use:

```shell
$ pip install httpx[http2]
```

HTTPX requires Python 3.8+.
