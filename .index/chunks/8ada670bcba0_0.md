        Can be a boolean, list, or string.
        ``True`` translates to 'gzip,deflate'.  If the dependencies for
        Brotli (either the ``brotli`` or ``brotlicffi`` package) and/or
        Zstandard (the ``backports.zstd`` package for Python before 3.14)
        algorithms are installed, then their encodings are
        included in the string ('br' and 'zstd', respectively).

        String will be used as provided.

    :param user_agent:
        String representing the user-agent you want, such as
        "python-urllib3/0.6"
